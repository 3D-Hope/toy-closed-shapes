    Constraints to be satisfied: {'constraints': [{'id': 'C1', 'name': 'kids_bed_present', 'description': 'Verifies that at least one kids_bed exists in the bedroom scene, confirming this is indeed a kids bedroom as specified by the user.'}, {'id': 'C2', 'name': 'table_height_unreachable_by_toddler', 'description': 'Ensures that any table objects (table, desk, dressing_table) in the scene have their top surface positioned at a height greater than 1.1 meters from the floor, making them unreachable by a 2-year-old child who can reach up to approximately 1.0-1.1 meters with arms extended. The table top height is calculated as the y-position (centroid) plus the half-height (size_y), since y-position represents the centroid and size represents half-extents.'}, {'id': 'C3', 'name': 'table_exists_in_scene', 'description': 'Verifies that at least one table-type object (table, desk, or dressing_table) exists in the scene. This is a prerequisite for applying the height constraint, as the safety requirement is meaningless without tables present.'}]}
