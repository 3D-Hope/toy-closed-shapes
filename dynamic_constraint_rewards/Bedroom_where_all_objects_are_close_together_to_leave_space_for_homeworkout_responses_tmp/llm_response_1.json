      "description": "Measures how closely furniture objects are grouped together. Calculates the compactness of furniture placement by measuring the average distance from each furniture piece to the centroid of all furniture. Lower average distance indicates tighter clustering."

      "description": "Ensures there is a significant contiguous open floor space available for home workout activities. Calculates the largest rectangular or circular area on the floor that is free from furniture obstacles. Target minimum area should be approximately 2m x 2m (4 square meters) for basic workout space."

      "name": "workout_space_centrality",
      "description": "Verifies that the open workout space is accessible and not fragmented into corners. Measures whether the largest open area is reasonably central or at least has one dimension that allows for movement exercises (lunges, yoga, etc.)."

      "id": "C4",
      "name": "furniture_wall_proximity",
      "description": "Encourages furniture to be positioned near walls/boundaries rather than in the center of the room. Calculates the average minimum distance from each furniture piece to the nearest room boundary. Lower values indicate furniture is pushed toward perimeter, leaving center clear."

      "id": "C5",
      "name": "minimum_workout_clearance",
      "description": "Ensures the workout area has sufficient vertical and horizontal clearance. Checks that the open space is free from overhead objects (like low pendant lamps) and has clear paths without narrow gaps between furniture that would impede movement."
