    User Prompt: I want to follow Vaastu for bedroom layout. The beds headboard should face east.
    Constraints to be satisfied: {'constraints': [{'id': 'C1', 'name': 'bed_headboard_faces_east', 'description': "Ensures that the bed's headboard faces east (+X direction). The bed should be oriented such that when a person lies on it, their head points toward the +X axis. This checks that the bed's forward direction (where the headboard is located) aligns with the east direction within an acceptable angular tolerance."}, {'id': 'C2', 'name': 'bed_exists_in_scene', 'description': 'Verifies that at least one bed object (double_bed, single_bed, or kids_bed) exists in the bedroom scene and is not marked as empty. This is a prerequisite for applying the headboard orientation constraint.'}, {'id': 'C3', 'name': 'bed_placement_stability', 'description': 'Ensures that the bed is placed on the floor (y-position approximately equals bed_height/2) and not floating or embedded in the floor. This validates proper vertical positioning for the Vaastu-compliant bed.'}]}
